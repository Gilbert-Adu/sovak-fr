      <div class="faq-answer">
        Every Report on RapeReportDB.com must be made under the Actual Name of the Person to Whom the Sexual Violence or Misconduct was committed.
	    The Reason for this strict, no-Exceptions Policy of requiring all Reports to be made under The Reporter’s own Name is instituted and enforced for the express purpose of reducing, and eventually hopefully eliminating (at some point in the future), the Stigma that is now ascribed -- altogether-unfittingly and -improperly, IMHO -- in our current culture to Persons Subjected to Acts of Sexual Violence or Misconduct.

        <span>What words can I use in my report/post?</span>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        As you may have noticed, pronouns can cause some problems.
	    I don’t like the word Victim, mostly because I sense some resistance among Victims to the word. --- Thus, I try to avoid the use of the word Victim.
	    Victims are thus referred to as Reporters, Rapees or Persons Subjected to Acts of Sexual Violence or Misconduct.  
	    I also don’t like the word Rapist. --- The reason why I don’t like the word Rapist is because the word Rapist has the suffix “–ist” at the end of it. --- This suffix -- “-ist” -- is currently a part of the word “Rapist” precisely because Rape used to have a Good Connotation (which the “–ist” suffix otherwise Connotes). --- Around 300 years ago, this was apparently true.
	    Well, it certainly isn’t true anymore. --- Rapers are not anything good or possessed of even the slightest socially-redeeming value. --- Rapers should be Identified and Shunned from decent society.
        Rapers are referred to, in the alternative, as Report Subjects or simply Subjects, or else Sexual Deviates or Deviants.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <span>Is there a reporting/posting style?</span>
          <span class="toggle-icon">›</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Although I am not requiring it absolutely, I strongly urge all Reporters to Report in as fact-based and emotion-free a manner as they possibly can. --- The reason for this is my Firm Belief that the most Clinical Description is the most persuasive. --- Name-Calling is strongly discouraged at all times, by all Parties and Commenters.
	        Language should be as clinical as possible. --- Our Species’ Primary and Secondary Sex Characteristics are known as: the Vagina, the Penis, the Breasts, the Mouth and the Anus. --- Colloquialisms for these body parts, or any other body parts, for that matter, are disfavored and discouraged at all times.
	        There is an important exception to this Policy of Discouraging Emotional, Name-Calling or Non-Clinical language: -- Anything that the Raper says that is relevant in the slightest way to the Rape or other Sexual Misconduct NOT ONLY CAN BE REPORTED, BUT SHOULD BE REPORTED.  
            Statements made by Deviants that are Audible to the Persons they Subject to Acts of Sexual Violence or Misconduct during the Commission of their Rapes or other Misconduct are properly known as CONFESSIONS;  and CONFESSIONS Absolutely and Un-Equivocally Should be Reported in all Cases wherein they occur, with the greatest detail that the Reporter can possibly muster.
	        The account of the Rape given by the Rapee, however, should always, to the extent reasonably-practical, maintain the clinical, un-emotional tone that best serves the Adjudication Process.

        The Culture of this Site is that Reporters are presumptively believed.  Subjects of Reports may Answer, if they choose to, and are encouraged to do so.
        At bottom, Verdicts after Trial will be decided by means of popular Vote of Registered non-Parties. --- This is essentially Trial by Jury, where the Jury is the Participating Public.
        Motions will be Decided by Paralegals providing Adjudication Services in return for being Paid by RapeReportDB.com, according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence, taking Full Note of the results of Public Votes on said Motions..
        Reporters, and Subjects who Answer, BOTH bear the burden of proving their Allegations via the submission of Admissible Evidence.

            The Fee for the Posting of a Report to the RapeReportDB.com Database is $49. --- The Fee for the Filing of an Answer is also $49. --- The Report and the Answer are collectively known as the Pleadings part of the litigation process.  Replies (to Answers) by Reporters, and Sur-Replies (to Replies) by Subjects, are also permitted during the Pleadings phase, and also cost $49 each.
	        The Fee to Post a Comment and//or a Vote is $0.49. --- Comments are sold in sets of 25, for $12.25, or 100 for $49. --- All Votes and Comments MUST be Made under the Commenter’s // Voter’s Own Name, just like for Reporters and Subjects.
